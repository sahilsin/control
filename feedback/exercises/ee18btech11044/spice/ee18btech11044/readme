This section contains all the files that have been generated and used in simulating the circuit using spice simulators
1. Open terminal in this folder and run the netlist
2.Makesure you have LM741.MOD in the working directory
3.Running the netlist will generate a ee18btech11044.dat file 
6.Visualise this .dat file using a python script ee18btech11044_spice.py
7.Run ee18btech11044_spice_2.py for generating a zoomed in plot to verify the frequency.
